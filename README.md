# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS

In this project, we will train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 


## The various steps followed:

Import libraries and datasets 

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

Plot the word cloud

Perform data cleaning - removing punctuation

Perform data cleaning - remove stop words

Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)

Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization

Understand the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers

Train a Naive Bayes Classifier

Assess trained model performance
